## Overview

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) used to design the Anti-Reflection coating, as detailed in the technical report titled "Technical Report on the Anti-Reflection Coating for Solar Cell: An analysis using the Transverse Matrix Method" by Josué Dazogbo.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into two main files: [ApplicationInterface.py](ApplicationInterface.py) and [Layer.py](Layer.py). The `ApplicationInterface.py` file houses the core functionalities, including the computation of reflectivity, transmittivity, and the optimization of layer configurations for specific wavelengths. The `Layer.py` file defines a versatile `Layer` class, encapsulating essential parameters for each layer, ensuring scalability for different configurations.

## Usage

To explore the anti-reflective coating design, follow these steps:

1. Run [ApplicationInterface.py](ApplicationInterface.py) to execute the code.
2. Choose the use case based on the provided options:
   - **Graphing Tool:** Visualize reflectivity as a function of wavelength.
   - **Reflectivity/Transmittivity Calculator:** Compute reflectivity and transmittivity for a given layer configuration.
   - **Triple Layer Power Calculator:** Analyze power received for a triple-layer system.

3. Follow on-screen prompts to input relevant parameters, such as the number of layers, index of refractions, and wavelength ranges.

## Conclusion

This GitHub repository serves as a practical guide for implementing and experimenting with anti-reflective coating designs for solar cells. The code's modularity and adaptability, coupled with insightful visualizations, make it a valuable resource for those interested in understanding and optimizing layer configurations for enhanced solar cell performance.
